#Game Flow overview 


    The game starts by giving the player a starting balance (e.g., £100).
    The player is asked how much they want to bet on the next spin.
    The game checks if that bet is allowed (it must be more than £0 and not exceed the current balance).
    The slot machine “spins” by randomly choosing one symbol per reel.
    The three symbols are shown to the player.
    The game checks if the symbols match (win condition).
    If it’s a win, the player’s balance increases based on a predefined multiplier. (see earlier)
    If it’s not, the bet amount is subtracted from their balance.
    The player is asked if they want to continue playing or exit the game.
    The loop continues until they leave or their balance reaches a certain amount in debt.
